Olin Course Prediction
======================

An attempt to predict the enrollment of Olin College courses based on preregistration survey data and Olin's course history. 

# Usage

  python olin_course_prediction.py

# Predictive Model

  We used scikit learn's Linear Regression model (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) to predict whether or not a student is likely to take a course in a specific semester, given their grade level.
